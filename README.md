# IBM-HR-Attrition-Case-Study
The IBM HR Attrition Case Study is a scenario in which a fictitious dataset is used to identify key factors that may predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not. The case study includes a comprehensive analysis of the data, as well as the use of predictive modeling techniques, in order to understand the most significant factors and make accurate predictions about employee attrition. The goal is to identify important factors that may be contributing to employee turnover, and to use this information to develop strategies for retaining valuable employees.
